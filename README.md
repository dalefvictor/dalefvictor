- 👋 Hi, I’m @dalefvictor, I am a professional woodworker, presently working at Overbay Houseworks in Warrenton, Oregon. They have a web site at http://www.overbayhouseworks.com. Check it out.
- 👀 Presently I am following the work Clough42 has done. I have an Atlas 10" lathe that I want to completely cnc. So far I am working on the spindle and the screw drives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about electronics, which I have not yet worked with. Learning much and perhaps someday I will know what I am doing.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate as I do not yet feel like I know what I am doing. When I get my project to work I will post about it.
- 📫 How to reach me, I am bad at answering e-mail. But any attempt at dalefvictor@gmail.com will be answered when I find it. Please put !!!!! in the subject along with a short message.
I have been a woodworker for over forty years, I do custom work through Overbay Houseworks, I no longer take on work by myself as I do not have time and am spending my extra time working on this project and writing a book or two. I am interested in hearing about other people and their projects.
I will try to answer any woodworking questions, take note that it may be some time until I find your e-mail. I will answer if I find it. At this time I get over a couple of hundred e-mails a day, most of it is just notices I do not need to respond to.
I also have interests in Physics, Math, Philosophy, and Astrophysics.
